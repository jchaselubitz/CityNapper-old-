# CityNapper
CityNapper is for people who fall asleep on public transportation. It tracks your location and wakes you up when you are about to arrive at your destination. 

## Features
* Set your location by searching common points of interest
* Save Home and Work locations 
* "Favorite" stations you use often
* Toggle between routes for public and private transit 
* Listen to the sounds of the rainforest during your nap

** CityNapper sets a backup alarm based on the estimated time to your destination, so it will even work for subway stops!**
